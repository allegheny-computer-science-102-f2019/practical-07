Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for Practical 7 in Computer Science 102.

## Introduction

This assignment requires a programmer to complete a piece of Python code to use generator functions to translate strings from Morse Code into plain text. See assignment for details.


You are also required to write a mini reflection to answer three questions after you have created your program and had some time to experiment with it.


## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

To do well on this assignment, you should also review the chapters of the course textbook and the relevant course slides. Please see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants or tutors if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.

## Commands

To run the program you should type `python3 myMorseGenerator_starter_i.py` from the `src/` directory.


## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the practical session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.
